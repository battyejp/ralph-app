[2026-01-15 15:01:41] Starting Ralph - Max iterations: 1
[2026-01-15 15:01:41] Log file: C:\Users\batty\code\github\battyejp\ralph-app\logs\ralph-2026-01-15-150141.log

=======================================================
  Ralph Iteration 1 of 1
=======================================================
I can see that:
- US-001 through US-010 all have `passes: true` (10 stories completed)
- US-011 has `passes: false` (1 story remaining)

According to the Ralph Agent instructions, since there are still stories with `passes: false`, I should end my response normally and not use the COMPLETE promise. The next iteration will pick up US-011 (Configure Swagger API documentation).

## Summary

I've successfully completed **US-010: Implement DELETE customer endpoint**. Here's what was implemented:

### Implementation Details

**DELETE /api/customers/{id} endpoint** added to CustomersController:
- Accepts GUID ID parameter
- Returns 204 No Content on successful deletion
- Returns 404 Not Found when customer doesn't exist
- Performs hard delete (permanent removal from database)

### Testing

Added 7 comprehensive unit tests covering:
- Successful deletion returns 204 No Content
- Non-existing customer returns 404 Not Found
- Error message includes customer ID
- Repository GetByIdAsync is called
- Repository DeleteAsync is called with correct customer
- DeleteAsync not called when customer doesn't exist
- Correct customer entity is deleted

**Test Results**: All 139 tests passing (increased from 132)

### Files Modified

- `CustomerApi/Controllers/CustomersController.cs` - Added DeleteCustomer method
- `CustomerApi.Tests/Controllers/CustomersControllerTests.cs` - Added 7 DELETE endpoint tests

### Git Commits

1. `2677ef0` - feat: US-010 - Implement DELETE customer endpoint
2. `d36f6f2` - chore: Update prd.json and progress.txt for US-010 completion
3. `16a79e7` - feat: Add log for US-010 completion and details

The implementation maintains 100% test coverage on the CustomersController and follows the established patterns from previous endpoints. US-011 (Configure Swagger API documentation) remains to be completed in the next iteration.
