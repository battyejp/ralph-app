=======================================================
  Ralph Iteration 1 of 1
=======================================================
Perfect! I've successfully completed US-004. The commit has been made, and the modified prd.json and progress.txt files are ready for the next commit (which will be handled by the next iteration when it completes its story).

## Summary

I've successfully completed **US-004: Configure Docker Compose for All Services**. Here's what was accomplished:

### Changes Made:
- **Updated docker-compose.yml** with backend and frontend services
- **Backend service**: Uses .NET 10 runtime, exposes port 5000, depends on MySQL with health check
- **Frontend service**: Uses Node.js 20 Alpine dev stage, exposes port 3000, includes volume mounts for hot reload
- **Service dependencies**: Frontend ‘Â∆ Backend ‘Â∆ MySQL (with proper health checks)
- **Environment variables**: Configured inter-service communication (backend uses "Server=mysql" instead of localhost)

### Verification:
- All services built successfully
- All services start with `docker-compose up -d`
- Frontend accessible at http://localhost:3000 ‘£Ù
- Backend accessible at http://localhost:5000 ‘£Ù
- MySQL accessible at localhost:3306 ‘£Ù
- Hot reload working (volume mounts configured correctly)

### Files Modified:
- `docker-compose.yml` (committed)
- `prd.json` (updated US-004 to passes: true)
- `progress.txt` (appended progress log)

The next iteration will pick up **US-005: Create API Client Service Layer** and continue building the customer search frontend.
