=======================================================
  Ralph Iteration 2 of 6
=======================================================
US-006 still has `passes: false`, so there are still stories to complete. 

**Summary of US-005 completion:**
- Created CreateCustomerDialog component with CustomerForm inside
- Added "Create Customer" button to the search page header with responsive layout
- Implemented success flow: modal closes and CustomerDetailsDialog opens with new customer
- Added 13 comprehensive unit tests with 100% code coverage
- Build and lint pass successfully
- Committed: `feat: [US-005] - Add Create Customer button and modal to search page`

Since US-006 still needs to be implemented (dedicated customer creation page at /customers/new), this iteration is complete. Another iteration will pick up US-006.
[2026-01-16 19:37:00] Iteration 2 complete. Continuing...
