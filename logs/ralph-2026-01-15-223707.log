=======================================================
  Ralph Iteration 1 of 4
=======================================================
Perfect! US-008 is complete and all commits are done. Since there are still incomplete user stories (US-009, US-010, US-011 all have `passes: false`), the Ralph agent loop will continue with the next iteration to work on US-009: Add Column Sorting.

The work completed for US-008 includes:
- Ô£à Pagination controls fully implemented
- Ô£à All tests passing with excellent coverage (94.94% statement, 97.95% branch)
- Ô£à Build successful
- Ô£à Code committed with proper messages
- Ô£à Documentation updated (prd.json and progress.txt)

The next Ralph iteration will pick up US-009 and continue the development process.
[2026-01-15 22:45:47] Iteration 1 complete. Continuing...

=======================================================
  Ralph Iteration 2 of 4
=======================================================
Excellent! **US-009: Add Column Sorting** has been successfully completed and committed. 

## Summary

I've successfully implemented column sorting for the customer search application:

### Ô£à All Acceptance Criteria Met
- Clickable column headers for Name, Email, and Created At
- Visual sort indicators (up/down arrows) showing active sort direction
- Toggle between ascending/descending on column click
- sortBy and sortOrder parameters sent to API
- Sort state preserved across pagination and filtering
- URL parameters updated with sort state
- Build successful with 118 tests passing at 95.05% coverage

### ­ƒôè Progress Status
- **Completed**: US-001 through US-009 (9 stories)
- **Remaining**: US-010 (Customer Details View) and US-011 (Error Handling)

### ­ƒöº Implementation Highlights
- Created reusable `SortableTableHeader` component with SVG arrow indicators
- Sort state synchronized across local state, URL params, and API calls
- Phone column intentionally non-sortable (backend limitation)
- Toggle logic: same column switches asc Ôåö desc, new column defaults to asc

The next iteration will pick up **US-010: Customer Details View** which involves creating a modal dialog to display full customer information.
[2026-01-15 22:52:00] Iteration 2 complete. Continuing...

=======================================================
  Ralph Iteration 3 of 4
=======================================================
Perfect! There is only one remaining story (US-011) with `passes: false`. According to the Ralph agent instructions, I should end my response normally since there are still stories remaining for the next iteration.

## Summary

I successfully completed **US-010: Customer Details View**. Here's what was implemented:

### Ô£à All Acceptance Criteria Met:

1. **Created customer details modal using shadcn/ui Dialog** - Built complete Dialog component with Radix UI primitives
2. **Display all customer fields** - Shows Name, Email, Phone, Address, Created At, Updated At
3. **Handle optional fields gracefully** - Null phone/address display as 'N/A'
4. **Add close button** - X button in top-right corner works correctly
5. **Show loading state** - Animated spinner while fetching customer data
6. **Show error state** - Displays "Customer not found" for 404s and generic errors for other failures
7. **Code builds successfully** - Next.js production build completed
8. **All Tests pass with 80%+ coverage** - 134 tests passing, 93.1% overall coverage (88.46% for dialog)
9. **Verify in browser** - Confirmed dialog opens, displays data correctly, and closes properly

### ­ƒôè Test Results:
- **Total Tests:** 134 passed
- **Overall Coverage:** 93.1% statements, 94.8% branches
- **CustomerDetailsDialog Coverage:** 88.46% statements, 82.35% branches

### ­ƒÄ¿ Browser Verification:
Successfully verified in browser that:
- Dialog opens when clicking on customer rows
- All customer information displays correctly
- Dates are properly formatted
- Close button functionality works
- Loading and error states function as expected

### ­ƒôØ Commits:
