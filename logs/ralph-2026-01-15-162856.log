=======================================================
  Ralph Iteration 1 of 1
=======================================================
I've successfully completed US-002: "Create Dockerfile for Frontend". 

## Summary

I created a multi-stage Dockerfile for the Next.js frontend with the following features:
- Node.js 20 Alpine base image
- Development stage with hot reload support (exposed on port 3000)
- Build and production stages for optimized deployment
- Added .dockerignore to optimize the Docker build context

The Docker image built successfully, and all changes have been committed with the appropriate commit messages. The PRD has been updated to mark US-002 as `passes: true`, and progress has been logged to progress.txt.

There are still more user stories to complete (US-003 through US-011 all have `passes: false`), so another iteration will pick up the next highest priority story.
[2026-01-15 16:35:54] Iteration 1 complete. Continuing...
[2026-01-15 16:35:56] Ralph reached max iterations (1) without completing all tasks.
