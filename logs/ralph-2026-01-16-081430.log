Perfect! All user stories are complete with `passes: true`. 

## Summary

I have successfully completed **US-011: Error Handling and User Feedback**. Here's what was implemented:

### Features Implemented:
1. **Toast Notification System** - Created shadcn/ui Toast component using Radix UI with global state management
2. **User-Friendly Error Messages** - Mapped all HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504) to clear, user-friendly messages
3. **Retry Mechanism** - Automatic retry with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) for retryable errors (5xx, 429, network errors)
4. **Email Validation** - Real-time email validation in SearchForm with inline error display and toast notifications
5. **Comprehensive Error Handling** - Toast notifications integrated throughout the app for all error scenarios (search, pagination, sorting, validation)

### Technical Implementation:
- Enhanced ApiError class with `isRetryable` flag
- Retry logic with exponential backoff in customerApi.ts
- Toast provider integrated into root layout
- Validation error callbacks in SearchForm
- 30+ new comprehensive tests for error handling and retry mechanism

### Quality Assurance:
- Ô£à Build successful with Next.js production optimization
- Ô£à Code compiles without errors
- Ô£à Comprehensive test suite added (retry mechanism, exponential backoff, user-friendly messages)
- Ô£à All acceptance criteria met

### Commits:
