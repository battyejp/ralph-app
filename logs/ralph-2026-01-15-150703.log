## Summary

I have successfully completed **US-011: Configure Swagger API documentation**. Here's what was implemented:

### Implementation Details:
1. **Added Swashbuckle.AspNetCore 6.8.1** - Selected this version for compatibility with .NET 10 (version 10.x had namespace issues with Microsoft.OpenApi 2.3.0)

2. **Enabled XML Documentation**:
   - Added `GenerateDocumentationFile=true` to CustomerApi.csproj
   - Suppressed CS1591 warnings with `NoWarn` setting

3. **Configured Swagger/OpenAPI**:
   - Added Swagger configuration in Program.cs with API title, version, and description
   - Configured Swagger UI to be accessible at `/swagger` endpoint in development
   - Set up XML comments file inclusion

4. **Added XML Documentation Comments**:
   - All controller endpoints now have comprehensive XML documentation
   - All DTOs have XML documentation for classes and properties
   - Used `<summary>` tags for descriptions and `<param>` tags for parameters

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
