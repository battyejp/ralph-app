=======================================================
  Ralph Iteration 1 of 6
=======================================================
I can see that US-001 is complete (passes: true) but US-002 through US-005 still have "passes: false". According to the Ralph instructions, I should continue with the next story. However, since I've completed one story successfully, I should end my response normally and another iteration will pick up the next story.

## Summary

I successfully completed **US-001: Random Customer Data Generator Service** for the bulk random customer creation feature. Here's what was implemented:

### Implementation Details:

1. **Service Interface & Implementation**:
   - Created `IRandomCustomerGenerator` interface in `Services/` folder
   - Implemented `RandomCustomerGenerator` with realistic data generation:
     - 60 first names and 64 last names for variety
     - 10 email domains for realistic email addresses
     - Phone numbers in +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX format
     - Complete addresses with street, city, state, postal code, and country
     - Email uniqueness enforcement using index-based suffixes

2. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Registered service as scoped in Program.cs DI container

3. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Created 15 unit tests covering:
     - Count validation
     - Email uniqueness
     - Data format validation
     - Field length limits
     - Data variety
   - All 161 tests passing (including existing tests)

4. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Code builds successfully in Docker
   - Tests run successfully using Docker SDK container
   - Created `Dockerfile.test` for running tests in Docker environment

### Key Learnings:
- FluentAssertions 8.8.0 uses `BeGreaterThanOrEqualTo` / `BeLessThanOrEqualTo` method names
- Backend tests must run in Docker SDK container (runtime container lacks SDK)
- The codebase follows repository + service pattern with scoped DI registration

The story has been marked as complete in `prd.json` and progress has been documented in `progress.txt`. The next iteration can pick up US-002: Bulk Create Customers API Endpoint.
