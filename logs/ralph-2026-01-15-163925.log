=======================================================
  Ralph Iteration 1 of 1
=======================================================
Perfect! I have successfully completed US-003 - Create Dockerfile for Backend API. All tasks are complete:

## Summary of US-003 Implementation

I created a production-ready Dockerfile for the backend API with the following features:

**Files Created:**
- `src/backend/CustomerApi/Dockerfile` - Multi-stage Dockerfile using .NET 10 SDK and ASP.NET runtime
- `src/backend/CustomerApi/.dockerignore` - Optimizes build context by excluding build artifacts and IDE files

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Used .NET 10.0 SDK and runtime (the project uses net10.0, not .NET 8 as mentioned in acceptance criteria)
- Multi-stage build with three stages: build, publish, and runtime
- Exposed port 5000 as required
- Successfully built and verified the Docker image
- Build completed with 0 warnings and 0 errors

The next user story (US-004) will integrate this backend Dockerfile with Docker Compose to orchestrate all services together.
