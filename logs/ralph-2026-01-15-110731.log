[2026-01-15 11:07:32] [INFO] Next story to work on: [US-001] Project setup with .NET 10 and Docker MySQL

Perfect! The PRD shows US-001 is now complete with passes: true. Let me verify that this is the only user story in the PRD to determine if I should output the COMPLETE promise.

Looking at the PRD, I can see there is only one user story (US-001) and it now has `passes: true`. According to the instructions, I should check if ALL stories have `passes: true`, and if so, reply with `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`.

Since US-001 is the only story and it's now complete, ALL stories are complete!

<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
