=======================================================
  Ralph Iteration 1 of 1
=======================================================
I can see that US-009 has been successfully completed. There are still 2 stories remaining with `passes: false`:
- US-010: Implement DELETE customer endpoint (priority 10)
- US-011: Configure Swagger API documentation (priority 11)

According to the Ralph agent instructions, I should work on ONE story per iteration and end my response normally so another iteration can pick up the next story.

## Summary

I have successfully completed **US-009: Implement PUT update customer endpoint**.

### What was implemented:
- Added `UpdateCustomer` method to `CustomersController` with PUT /api/customers/{id} endpoint
- Endpoint accepts `UpdateCustomerDto` in request body and returns 200 OK with updated `CustomerResponseDto`
- Returns 404 Not Found when customer doesn't exist with descriptive error message
- Returns 400 Bad Request for invalid model state with validation details
- Automatically updates `UpdatedAt` to current UTC time on every update
- Preserves `CreatedAt` timestamp from the original customer (immutable field)
- Preserves customer `Id` during update operation

### Test coverage:
- Added 11 comprehensive unit tests covering all scenarios:
  - Valid update returns 200 OK
  - Non-existing customer returns 404
  - Invalid model state returns 400
  - CreatedAt preservation
  - UpdatedAt automatic updating
  - Repository method verification
  - Optional fields handling
  - Max length fields
  - Id preservation
- All 132 tests passing with 100% coverage on CustomersController

### Files modified:
- `CustomerApi/Controllers/CustomersController.cs:139-180` - Added UpdateCustomer endpoint
- `CustomerApi.Tests/Controllers/CustomersControllerTests.cs:1266-1653` - Added 11 test methods

The implementation follows the established patterns from previous endpoints and maintains consistency across the codebase.
