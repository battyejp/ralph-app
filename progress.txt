Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented Next.js frontend project initialization
- Created complete Next.js 14 project structure with TypeScript and App Router
- Configured Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui design system
- Set up project directories: src/app, src/components, src/lib
- Added environment configuration for API URL
- Created comprehensive .gitignore for frontend
- Added README with setup instructions

**Files Created:**
- package.json (Next.js dependencies and scripts)
- tsconfig.json (TypeScript configuration)
- next.config.ts (Next.js configuration)
- tailwind.config.ts (Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui theme)
- postcss.config.mjs (PostCSS configuration)
- .eslintrc.json (ESLint configuration)
- components.json (shadcn/ui configuration)
- src/app/layout.tsx (Root layout)
- src/app/page.tsx (Home page)
- src/app/globals.css (Global styles with theme variables)
- src/lib/utils.ts (Utility functions for className merging)
- .env.local and .env.example (Environment configuration)
- .gitignore (Frontend-specific gitignore)
- README.md (Setup instructions)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Node.js is not installed on the host system, so manual scaffolding was required
- The project will need to be run via Docker (see US-002, US-004)
- shadcn/ui dependencies include: @radix-ui components, class-variance-authority, clsx, tailwind-merge, lucide-react
- Environment variables use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for client-side access
- Next.js 14 uses App Router (app directory) not Pages Router

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Created multi-stage Dockerfile for Next.js frontend
- Configured development stage with hot reload support
- Added build and production stages for optimized deployment
- Created .dockerignore to optimize build context
- Successfully built Docker image for dev stage

**Files Created:**
- src/frontend/Dockerfile (Multi-stage Docker build)
- src/frontend/.dockerignore (Optimize build context)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Docker builds successfully using Node.js 20 Alpine
- Multi-stage build includes: base, deps, dev, builder, production stages
- Development stage uses `npm run dev` with hot reload support
- Port 3000 exposed for Next.js development server
- .dockerignore should exclude node_modules, .next, out, .git to reduce build context size
- Without .dockerignore, build context was over 360MB; with it, much smaller and faster
- Production stage requires standalone output configuration in next.config.ts (for future)

## 2026-01-15 16:40 - US-003
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Created multi-stage Dockerfile for .NET backend API
- Configured build, publish, and runtime stages
- Added .dockerignore to optimize build context
- Successfully built and verified Docker image

**Files Created:**
- src/backend/CustomerApi/Dockerfile (Multi-stage Docker build)
- src/backend/CustomerApi/.dockerignore (Optimize build context)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Backend uses .NET 10.0 (net10.0), not .NET 8 as originally specified
- Used mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:10.0 for build stage
- Used mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:10.0 for runtime stage
- Multi-stage build includes: build, publish, and runtime stages
- API exposed on port 5000 via ASPNETCORE_URLS environment variable
- .dockerignore should exclude bin/, obj/, .vs/, .vscode/ to reduce build context
- Dockerfile uses dotnet restore, build, and publish commands in sequence
- Build completed successfully with 0 warnings and 0 errors

## 2026-01-15 19:13 - US-004
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Configured Docker Compose for all services (MySQL, Backend API, Frontend)
- Added backend service with proper dependencies and health checks
- Added frontend service with volume mounts for hot reload support
- Verified all services start successfully and are accessible
- Frontend accessible at http://localhost:3000
- Backend accessible at http://localhost:5000 (healthy)
- MySQL accessible at localhost:3306

**Files Modified:**
- docker-compose.yml (Added backend and frontend services)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Backend service depends on MySQL with health check condition
- Frontend service depends on backend (basic dependency, no health check needed)
- Backend uses ASPNETCORE_URLS environment variable to bind to port 5000
- Backend connection string uses "Server=mysql" (service name) instead of localhost
- Frontend uses volume mounts for hot reload: ./src/frontend:/app with exclusions for node_modules and .next
- Frontend target is "dev" stage from multi-stage Dockerfile for development mode
- All services use restart: always for automatic recovery
- Backend health check uses curl to /health endpoint with 30s start_period
- NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL should point to http://localhost:5000 for client-side API calls

## 2026-01-15 19:28 - US-005
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented API Client Service Layer for frontend
- Created TypeScript interfaces matching backend DTOs (Customer, PaginatedResponse, CustomerSearchParams, ApiErrorResponse)
- Implemented customerApi service with searchCustomers() and getCustomerById() methods
- Added comprehensive error handling with custom ApiError class
- Configured Jest testing framework for frontend
- Created comprehensive test suite with 15 tests, 97.82% coverage
- Build verified successfully via Docker
- API connectivity verified

**Files Created:**
- src/frontend/src/lib/api/types.ts (TypeScript interfaces)
- src/frontend/src/lib/api/customerApi.ts (API client service with error handling)
- src/frontend/src/lib/api/customerApi.test.ts (Comprehensive test suite)
- src/frontend/jest.config.js (Jest configuration with 80% coverage threshold)
- src/frontend/jest.setup.js (Jest setup file)

**Files Modified:**
- src/frontend/package.json (Added Jest, testing-library, test scripts)
- src/frontend/package-lock.json (Dependency updates)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- API client uses singleton pattern exported as `customerApi`
- ApiError class extends Error with status and errors properties for structured error handling
- Network errors (TypeError) are caught and wrapped in ApiError with user-friendly messages
- Base URL is configured from NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL environment variable (defaults to http://localhost:5000)
- Query parameters are built using URLSearchParams for proper encoding
- Jest tests use mocked global.fetch for isolated unit testing
- Coverage excludes src/app/** and src/lib/utils.ts to focus on API client code
- Tests must be run in Docker since Node.js is not installed on host
- Build command: `docker run --rm frontend-dev npm run build`
- Test command: `docker run --rm frontend-dev npm test -- --coverage`
- The backend requires database migrations to be applied before the Customers table exists (this will need to be addressed in future iterations)

## 2026-01-15 19:45 - US-006
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented Advanced Search Form with multiple filter fields
- Created shadcn/ui components: Button, Input, Label in src/components/ui/
- Built SearchForm component with three search fields:
  - General search (name/email)
  - Email exact match
  - Phone number search
- Implemented useDebounce custom hook with 500ms delay for better UX
- Added clear/reset filters functionality
- Integrated SearchForm into home page with loading state
- Created comprehensive test suite with 45 test cases
- Achieved 96.42% branch coverage (exceeds 80% requirement)
- Build verified successfully in Docker
- Browser verification completed using dev-browser skill
- All functionality working: form inputs, search button, clear button, responsive design

**Files Created:**
- src/frontend/src/components/ui/button.tsx (shadcn/ui Button component)
- src/frontend/src/components/ui/input.tsx (shadcn/ui Input component)
- src/frontend/src/components/ui/label.tsx (shadcn/ui Label component)
- src/frontend/src/components/SearchForm.tsx (Main search form component)
- src/frontend/src/components/SearchForm.test.tsx (Comprehensive test suite with 28 tests)
- src/frontend/src/hooks/useDebounce.ts (Custom debounce hook)
- src/frontend/src/hooks/useDebounce.test.ts (Hook tests with 17 test cases)

**Files Modified:**
- src/frontend/src/app/page.tsx (Integrated SearchForm with state management)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- shadcn/ui components were created manually since npx is not available on host
- Components use Radix UI primitives (@radix-ui/react-slot, @radix-ui/react-label)
- Button component uses class-variance-authority for variant management
- useDebounce hook is critical for good UX - prevents excessive API calls
- SearchForm uses controlled inputs with React useState
- Phone search is combined with general search parameter in API call
- Form is responsive using Tailwind classes: grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3, flex-col sm:flex-row
- Loading state disables all inputs and buttons during search
- Tests mock useDebounce to make them synchronous for easier testing
- Browser verification using dev-browser skill confirmed all interactive functionality
- Next.js 14 'use client' directive required for components with useState
