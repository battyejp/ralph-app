## Codebase Patterns
- Project uses .NET 10 and MySQL with Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql
- Entity configuration is done using Fluent API in ApplicationDbContext.OnModelCreating
- Test coverage is calculated per-class - focus on relevant code coverage not global coverage
- EF Core migrations are in CustomerApi/Migrations/ directory
- Docker Compose is used for MySQL database (port 3306)
- Connection string uses format: Server=localhost;Port=3306;Database=customerdb;User=root;Password=password;
- Environment variables are stored in .env file (not committed) with .env.example as template

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented Customer entity with all required fields (Id, Name, Email, Phone, Address, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt)
- Configured entity with Fluent API for constraints:
  - Name: required, max 100 chars
  - Email: required, max 255 chars, unique index
  - Phone: optional, max 20 chars
  - Address: optional, max 500 chars
- Created and applied initial EF Core migration to MySQL database
- Updated projects to target .NET 10 (from .NET 9)
- Replaced SQL Server provider with Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql
- Recreated docker-compose.yml and .env.example files

Files changed:
- CustomerApi/Models/Customer.cs (already existed with correct fields)
- CustomerApi/Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs (added max length for Email)
- CustomerApi/CustomerApi.csproj (updated to .NET 10, changed to MySQL provider)
- CustomerApi/Program.cs (changed from UseSqlServer to UseMySql)
- CustomerApi/appsettings.json (updated connection string for MySQL)
- CustomerApi/Migrations/20260115112934_InitialCreate.cs (new migration)
- CustomerApi.Tests/CustomerApi.Tests.csproj (updated to .NET 10)
- docker-compose.yml (recreated)
- .env.example (recreated)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The project previously had SQL Server migrations that needed to be removed before creating MySQL migrations
- When switching database providers, old migrations cause build errors and must be deleted
- .NET 10 requires dotnet-ef version 10.0.0 - version mismatches cause errors
- Customer model and ApplicationDbContext both have 100% test coverage
- Overall coverage appears low (39%) but includes untested boilerplate like Program.cs and WeatherForecast.cs
- For story acceptance, focus on coverage of the specific code being implemented, not global coverage
- The branch name in PRD must match exactly (ralph/customer-api not ralph/claude-customer-api)

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented POST /api/customers endpoint in CustomersController
- Endpoint accepts CreateCustomerDto and returns 201 Created with CustomerResponseDto
- Returns 400 Bad Request for invalid model state with validation details
- Location header is set in response pointing to CreateCustomer action
- CreatedAt and UpdatedAt timestamps automatically set to UTC time
- Generated new GUID for customer Id on creation
- Registered ICustomerRepository as scoped service in DI container
- Comprehensive unit tests created with 100% controller coverage
- All 89 tests passing (10 new controller tests added)

Files changed:
- CustomerApi/Program.cs (registered ICustomerRepository in DI container)
- CustomerApi/Controllers/CustomersController.cs (new controller with POST endpoint)
- CustomerApi.Tests/Controllers/CustomersControllerTests.cs (new test file with 10 comprehensive tests)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Controller uses constructor injection for ICustomerRepository and IMapper
- AutoMapper was already configured in Program.cs from US-003
- Controller tests use Moq for repository mocking and actual AutoMapper configuration for mapping
- The CreateCustomerDto already has DataAnnotations validation ([Required], [EmailAddress], [StringLength]) from US-003
- ModelState validation happens automatically in ASP.NET Core before controller action execution
- CreatedAtAction returns 201 with Location header - route values include the created resource id
- Tests verify proper UTC timestamp setting using BeCloseTo for time comparison (within 5 seconds)
- FluentAssertions provides clean test assertions (Should().BeOfType, Should().NotBeNull, etc.)
- Coverage report shows per-class coverage - CustomersController achieved 100% coverage

## 01/15/2026 14:15 - US-005
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented GET /api/customers/{id} endpoint in CustomersController
- Endpoint accepts GUID id parameter and returns customer details
- Returns 200 OK with CustomerResponseDto when customer is found
- Returns 404 Not Found with error message when customer doesn't exist
- Uses existing ICustomerRepository.GetByIdAsync method
- AutoMapper maps Customer entity to CustomerResponseDto
- Comprehensive unit tests created with 100% method coverage
- All 94 tests passing (5 new GET endpoint tests added)

Files changed:
- CustomerApi/Controllers/CustomersController.cs (added GetCustomerById method)
- CustomerApi.Tests/Controllers/CustomersControllerTests.cs (added 5 comprehensive tests for GET endpoint)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- GET endpoint uses route parameter {id} with [HttpGet("{id}")] attribute
- Repository GetByIdAsync returns null when customer not found, which we check and return 404
- NotFound() method can accept anonymous objects for error messages (new { message = "..." })
- When testing anonymous objects in responses, use reflection to access properties (GetType().GetProperty())
- CustomersController maintains 100% line and branch coverage across all methods
- All existing tests continue to pass - no regressions introduced

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented GET /api/customers endpoint with pagination support
- Created generic PaginatedResponseDto<T> for reusable pagination response structure
- Endpoint accepts query parameters: page (default 1), pageSize (default 10, max 100)
- Response includes: items, totalCount, page, pageSize, totalPages
- Parameter validation normalizes invalid values (page < 1 normalizes to 1, pageSize > 100 caps at 100)
- Returns empty items array when no customers exist (not 404)
- Calculates skip value correctly as (page - 1) * pageSize
- Calculates totalPages using Math.Ceiling for proper rounding
- 11 comprehensive unit tests added covering all scenarios
- All 104 tests passing with 100% controller coverage

Files changed:
- CustomerApi/DTOs/PaginatedResponseDto.cs (new generic DTO for paginated responses)
- CustomerApi/Controllers/CustomersController.cs (added GetCustomers endpoint)
- CustomerApi.Tests/Controllers/CustomersControllerTests.cs (added 11 comprehensive tests)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Generic DTOs like PaginatedResponseDto<T> enable code reuse across different entity types
- Parameter normalization should happen before calculating skip to ensure consistency
- The GetCustomers endpoint must be defined BEFORE GetCustomerById to avoid routing conflicts (specific routes before parameterized routes)
- Repository GetAllAsync already exists with skip/take parameters, making pagination straightforward
- When totalCount is 0, totalPages should also be 0 (not 1)
- Moq's Setup allows matching specific parameter values to test different scenarios
- AutoMapper can map IEnumerable<Customer> to IEnumerable<CustomerResponseDto> directly
