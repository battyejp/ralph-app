## 2026-01-15 16:10 - US-001
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented Next.js frontend project initialization
- Created complete Next.js 14 project structure with TypeScript and App Router
- Configured Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui design system
- Set up project directories: src/app, src/components, src/lib
- Added environment configuration for API URL
- Created comprehensive .gitignore for frontend
- Added README with setup instructions

**Files Created:**
- package.json (Next.js dependencies and scripts)
- tsconfig.json (TypeScript configuration)
- next.config.ts (Next.js configuration)
- tailwind.config.ts (Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui theme)
- postcss.config.mjs (PostCSS configuration)
- .eslintrc.json (ESLint configuration)
- components.json (shadcn/ui configuration)
- src/app/layout.tsx (Root layout)
- src/app/page.tsx (Home page)
- src/app/globals.css (Global styles with theme variables)
- src/lib/utils.ts (Utility functions for className merging)
- .env.local and .env.example (Environment configuration)
- .gitignore (Frontend-specific gitignore)
- README.md (Setup instructions)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Node.js is not installed on the host system, so manual scaffolding was required
- The project will need to be run via Docker (see US-002, US-004)
- shadcn/ui dependencies include: @radix-ui components, class-variance-authority, clsx, tailwind-merge, lucide-react
- Environment variables use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for client-side access
- Next.js 14 uses App Router (app directory) not Pages Router

## 2026-01-15 16:35 - US-002
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Created multi-stage Dockerfile for Next.js frontend
- Configured development stage with hot reload support
- Added build and production stages for optimized deployment
- Created .dockerignore to optimize build context
- Successfully built Docker image for dev stage

**Files Created:**
- src/frontend/Dockerfile (Multi-stage Docker build)
- src/frontend/.dockerignore (Optimize build context)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Docker builds successfully using Node.js 20 Alpine
- Multi-stage build includes: base, deps, dev, builder, production stages
- Development stage uses `npm run dev` with hot reload support
- Port 3000 exposed for Next.js development server
- .dockerignore should exclude node_modules, .next, out, .git to reduce build context size
- Without .dockerignore, build context was over 360MB; with it, much smaller and faster
- Production stage requires standalone output configuration in next.config.ts (for future)

## 2026-01-15 16:40 - US-003
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Created multi-stage Dockerfile for .NET backend API
- Configured build, publish, and runtime stages
- Added .dockerignore to optimize build context
- Successfully built and verified Docker image

**Files Created:**
- src/backend/CustomerApi/Dockerfile (Multi-stage Docker build)
- src/backend/CustomerApi/.dockerignore (Optimize build context)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Backend uses .NET 10.0 (net10.0), not .NET 8 as originally specified
- Used mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:10.0 for build stage
- Used mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:10.0 for runtime stage
- Multi-stage build includes: build, publish, and runtime stages
- API exposed on port 5000 via ASPNETCORE_URLS environment variable
- .dockerignore should exclude bin/, obj/, .vs/, .vscode/ to reduce build context
- Dockerfile uses dotnet restore, build, and publish commands in sequence
- Build completed successfully with 0 warnings and 0 errors
